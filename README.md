-This is basic example of creating application from scratch while consuming Web API into MVC application, 
implementing security in Web API then connecting SQL and also using Entity Framework and writing LINQ queries.

-Every step will be different commit so you can check what have I done in every step, also I will try my best to explain every step in few words.

-I will put more data when the application is finished and make some improvements on the look of this application.
